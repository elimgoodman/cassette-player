- why "path" for things like getVariable? why not just a straight key?
- I'll do one holistic pass at some point to make sure the verbiage is consistent (ie name vs path vs id)

API:

$scenes
 - getCurrent()
- getById(id)
$self
 - variables only, no methods
$program (not sure that this is necessary...)
 - variables only
$assets
 - getByPath(path)
$objects
 - getById(id)
 - getAllByTag(tag)
$actions
- getVariable({ object, path, badge? })
- setVariable({ object, path, value, badge? })
- fireEvent({ target(s), eventName, payload })
- spawn({ clone?, variables?, badges? })
- destroy({ target(s) })
- goToScene({ scene, variables? })
- changeFace({ target(s), faceConfig })
- playAnimation({ target(s), animationName })
- playSound({ sound })

Questions:

- should the common variables...
  - be in some namespace called “common” inside of variables
  - just be in the top level of the variables set, with no concept of namespace within variables (simplest...)
  - be in a badge applied to all objects called “common”
